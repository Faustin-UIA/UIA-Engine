// =====================================================
// UIA Engine v3.3 – Batch runner with inline telemetry (provider-agnostic)
// Usage examples:
//   node index.js --A=all --prompts=6 --concurrency=6 --model=gpt-4o-mini --t=0.2 --max_tokens=180 --log=results/uia_run.jsonl --metrics=true --diag=true
//   PROVIDER=openai LLM_EXEC="node adapters/openai_chat.js" node index.js --diag=true
//
// Provider abstraction (required):
//   • Set ENV LLM_EXEC to a command that accepts one JSON on STDIN and streams NDJSON on STDOUT.
//   • Expected NDJSON stream messages (by line):
//        {"type":"start"}                 // optional
//        {"type":"delta","content":"..."} // repeated; text deltas
//        {"type":"end"}                   // required to signal completion
//     As a fallback, a single JSON is also accepted:
//        {"type":"full","content":"..."}  // one-shot, non-streaming
//   • Your GitHub Action (e.g., uia-bench-openai.yml) is responsible for providing this adapter.
